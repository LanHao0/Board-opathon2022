## Check Point 1
The new string S1 is formed with the name letter signed up in all uppercase (Chinese is converted to the corresponding pinyin, without any space) + the string "2425". The MD5 string S1 is used to obtain S2. The last letter of S2 is converted to the decimal system to obtain the number I1. Add I3 by 1 to get the number I4, which is your group number (1-5).
